Andreas completed the Mildred Harnack high school and then proceeded to work as a carpenter. When he got disenchanted by his profession he started contemplating his next move. The world of computer science always appealed to him, so he taught himself HTML, CSS and PHP. After he randomly met Harry and Martin in Berlin, Andreas became the first employee of Hack&Craft.
