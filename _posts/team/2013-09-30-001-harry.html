Harry is the co-founder and managing director at Hack&Craft. He has a masters degree in philosophy but found programming to be a more reliable way of paying the rent. After founding several successful companies in the UK he moved to Berlin in 2009. He has a knack for turning ideas into real life things and founded Hack&Craft to help others do the same.
