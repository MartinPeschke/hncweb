One of the big TV stations wanted to launch an online fitness platform and we were tasked with building the web and mobile applications for it.
For this we designed, built and put in all the user tracking and customer analysis mechanizations you usually only see on those very large high volume websites.
The platform was built to withstand hundreds of thousands of concurrent users and when the TV spots launched, no performance degradation could be measured.

For this we presented 3 unique branding/design guides, developed a scalable solution complete with a custom HTML5 video player and iPhone and android apps in record time.
After the successful launch we trained internal staff to continue maintaining the platform.
