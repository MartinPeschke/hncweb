Friendfund was one of the first crowdfunding platforms in Europe. Targeted at friends, families and communities, Friendfund is an established, trustworthy and effective crowdfunding platform.
The first version was built in only 10 weeks back in 2010 and since then has seen countless content tests and optimisations based on user feedback.
