                Agile software development is not easy. Doing it the SCRUM way is even harder.
                All agile methodologies transfer a lot of responsibility to developers and require management through monitoring rather than micro management.
                This is a difficult change for developers as well as managers. We have helped teams get started with agile development as well as optimised their ongoing agile efforts for maximum results.
