        Friendfund is powered by a flexible, purpose built group payment engine that easily accommodates single as well as group transactions, configurable staggered discount models, funding over-subscription and debt workflows for refused payments.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The friendfund group payment engine can be integrated into any merchant shop through its white labelling portal.
        Integration can be as simple as copy & pasting the 'friendfund it' button, a javascript snippet not unlike the Facebook Like button.
        This button leads customers through a custom branded group payment system powered by friendfund.
