description: One of the big TV stations wanted to launch an online fitness platform. We were tasked to incept a coherent product vision and build the web and mobile applications for it. We designed, built and put in all the user tracking and customer analysis mechanisations you only see on those very large high volume websites. The platform was built to withstand hundreds of thousands of concurrent users and when the TV spots aired the platform did not experience any performance degradation.<br/><br/>For this we presented a branding & design guide, developed a scalable solution complete with a custom HTML5 video player and iPhone and Android apps in 6 weeks. After the successful launch we trained internal staff to continue maintaining the platform.

                We developed fully separate workout worlds, completely custom branded frontends for each trainer.
                Administrators are able to upload the assets and thus set up a new work out world without further programming.
