          <p>All our projects begin with a workshop where we sit down with the client to discuss the product in general. 
What are the key features of this product? Who is the user? When we have a general overview of the product and its purpose on the market, we identify the key user stories and value creating features. This gives us and the client an accurate idea of how much time and resources we will need to build the product.</p>
          <p>Our clients are always involved in the work process because client feedback is key to how Hack&Craft works. 
The client must completely understand whatâ€™s happening with their product at all times and must be able to test it as we build it. That way necessary changes and improvements to the product can easily be made while its still in development stage. </p>
          <p>Every week at Hack&Craft starts with a meeting, where we determine the features that will be developed in that week. At the end of the seven day period, the client gets to test the product.  After 24 hours we discuss the tested features with the client, decide how we want to continue the development process and put together another weekly plan. </p>
          <p>This has always been our approach to every project and so far it has proven to be  the most effective method for working quickly, trouble-shooting potential complications before they even happen and bringing every product we take on to the next level as we develop it.</p>
