          <p>
            All our projects begin with a workshop where we sit down with the client to discuss the product in general. What are the key features of this product? Who is the user?
            When we have a general overview of the product and its purpose on the market, we identify the key user stories and value creating features.
            This gives us and the client an accurate idea of how much time and resources we will need to build the product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our clients are always involved in the work process because client feedback is key to how Hack&Craft works.
            The client must completely understand what?s happening with their product at all times and must be able to test it as we build it.
            That way necessary changes and improvements to the product can easily be made while its still in development stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the end of the seven day period, the client gets to test the product.
            After 24 hours we discuss the tested features with the client, decide how we want to continue the development process and put together another weekly plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is our approach to projects and has proven to be the most effective method for working quickly,
            trouble-shooting potential complications before they arise and bringing every product we take on to the next level as we develop it.

              Every sprint at Hack&Craft starts with a meeting.
              In this meeting all features to be developed and deployed during this sprint get discussed, prioritized and documented as user stories.

            <p>
              User stories get broken down into manageable tasks and assigned among the team.
              Whether its coding, designing, architecting, or anything else, this is where your idea comes to life.
              This is the do-not-disturb, head-phones-on phase in each sprint.

              When the keyboards fall silent and the headphones come off, our QA team takes over and scrutinises the work results for bugs, usability, performance and generally all kinds of mishaps that can happen.

              The product gets deployed into a demo environment available to you. You get to test drive all that has been achieved in this iteration and focus on what comes next.
